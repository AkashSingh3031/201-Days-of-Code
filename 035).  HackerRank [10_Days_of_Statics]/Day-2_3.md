# DAY-2
### 1st Question
Objective--------->
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. Check out the Tutorial tab for a breakdown of probability fundamentals!


Task----------->
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.

Answer---------->
<p>2 / 3</p>
* <p>5 / 6</p> ( CURRECT )
<p>1 / 4</p>
<p>1 / 6</p>

=============================================================================

### 2nd Question
Objective--------->
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. We recommend you review the previous challenge's Tutorial before attempting this problem.


Task--------->
In a single toss 2 of  fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.

Answer---------->
* 1 / 9 ( CURRECT )
1 / 6
2 / 3
5 / 6
=============================================================================

### 3rd Question
Objective----------->
In this challenge, we practice calculating the probability of a compound event. We recommend you review today's Probability Tutorial before attempting this challenge.

Task------------>
There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.

* Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
* Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
* Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

10 / 63
2 / 7
* 17 / 42 ( CURRECT )
31 / 126

# Day-3
### 1st Question
Objective------------->
In this challenge, we get started with conditional probability. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials!

Task---------------->
Suppose a family has  children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

* 1 / 3 ( CURRECT )
1 / 2
2 / 3
1 / 9
==================================================

### 2nd Question
Objective------------->
In this challenge, we're getting started with combinations and permutations. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials!

Task---------------->
You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

1 / 156
1 / 39
12 / 39
* 12 / 51 ( CURRECT )
===================================================

### 3rd Question
Objective
In this challenge, we're reinforcing what we've learned today. In case you've missed them, today's tutorials are on Conditional Probability and Combinations and Permutations.


Task
A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

1 / 12
7 / 12
1 / 6
* 2 / 3 ( CURRECT )
